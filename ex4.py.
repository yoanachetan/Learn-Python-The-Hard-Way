#Study Drills

#1. I used 4.0 for space_in_a_car, but is that necessary? What happens if it’s just 4?
#If the integer `4` was used vs. `4.0`, the `carpool_capacity` would be integer `120` vs. floating point `120.0`. The floating point is not necessary.
#2. Remember that 4.0 is a floating point number. It’s just a number with a decimal point, and you need 4.0 instead of just 4 so that it is floating point.
#3. Write comments above each of the variable assignments.
#4. Make sure you know what= is called (equals) and that its purpose is to give data(numbers,strings, etc.) names (cars_driven, passengers).
#5. Remember that_is an underscore character.
#6. Try running python3.6 from the Terminal as a calculator like you did before, and use variable names to do your calculations. Popular variable names are also i, x, and j.
