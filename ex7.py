#Study Drills
#For these next few exercises, you will have the exact same Study Drills.
#1. Go back through and write a comment on what each line does.
#2. Read each one backward or out loud to find your errors.
#3. From now on, when you make mistakes, write down on a piece of paper what kind of mistake you made
#4. When you go to the next exercise,look at the mistakes you have made and try not to make them in this new one.
#5. Remember that everyone makes mistakes. Programmers are like magicians who fool everyone into thinking they are perfect and never wrong, but itâ€™s all an act. They make mistakes all the time.
