Study Drills
#1. Above each line,use the #to write a comment to yourself explaining what the line does.
# done
#2. Remember in Exercise 0 when you started python3.6? Start python 3.6 this way again and,using the math operators, use Python as a calculator.
#3. Find something you need to calculate and write a new .py file that does it.
#4. Rewrite ex3.py to use floating point numbers so itâ€™s more accurate. 20.0isfloating point.
