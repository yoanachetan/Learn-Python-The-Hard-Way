#Study Drills
#The Study Drills contain things you should try to do. If you canâ€™t, skip it and come back later. For this exercise, try these things:
#1. Make your script print another line.
#2. Make your script print only one of the lines.
#3. Put a # (octothorpe) character at the beginning of a line. What did it do? Try to find out what this character does.
