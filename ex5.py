Study Drills
#1. Go through this program and write a comment above each line explaining it. 
#2. Find all the places where a string is put inside a string.
#3. Are you sure there are only four places? How do you know? Maybe I like lying. 
#4. Explain why adding the two strings w and e with + makes a longer string.
